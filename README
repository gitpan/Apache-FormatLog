NAME

Apache::FormatLog

SYNOPSIS

use Apache::FormatLog;
$lf = Apache::FormatLog->new($r);
$logdata = $lf->getLogData();
$logline = $lf->toString();


DESCRIPTION

Apache::FormatLog is the base interface module for creating FormatLogs from mod_perl.
There are currently two extensions available: Apache::FormatLog::Common,
and Apache::FormatLog::Combined. The default distribution comes with these two modules.

ABOUT

The Apache::LogFormat module uses it's own function for date formatting.
This is done because existing modules for extensive date formatting are quite heavy 
to use on a high load platform like apache can be. 
Especially the algorithm for calculating and formatting the time zone offset deserved
my special attention.
